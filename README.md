Developed a banking transaction processing software for RU Bank. The interactive system, accessed via the terminal, will handle transactions like opening/closing accounts, depositing/withdrawing money, and displaying account details. The system supports four account types: Checking, College Checking, Savings, and Money Market Savings, each with specific rules and options. The transactions are initiated through command lines, with commands like 'O' for opening an account, 'C' for closing, 'D' for deposit, 'W' for withdrawal, 'P' for displaying accounts, 'PI' for displaying accounts with calculated fees and interests, 'UB' for updating balances, and 'Q' for program termination.
